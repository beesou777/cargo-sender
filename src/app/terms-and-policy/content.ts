Cargosender COMPANY

Cargosender COMPANY is a private limited liability company operated by Binod Acharya Unip. LDA, tax number 516964992, with its registered address at Rua Lucinda Simoes 9A, 1900-304 Lisboa. The company manages the Cargosender.com online booking system and offers logistics service bookings directly to clients.

Cargosender acts as a freight forwarder, not as a carrier. By placing an order through Cargosender.com, the client authorizes Cargosender, in its own name (Cargosender’s name) and on behalf of the client (consignor), to order logistics services from a logistics provider that meets the requirements for executing the ordered service.

Established Communication Channels

Clients may contact Cargosender in writing via the contact form available at Cargosender.com, the chat function on the website, or through a direct email to a Cargosender representative (using the @cargosender.com domain). Clients may also reach out via telephone using the provided numbers or a direct line to a Cargosender representative.

For providing Cargosender with any information that may cause significant changes to the contractual relationship, such as cancellations, modifications to a placed order, closing or altering a user account, invoicing methods, or initiating a claim or complaint procedure, only written communication channels will be accepted. Any such information provided through other channels must be confirmed in writing by the client and Cargosender, with a confirmation sent to the client’s email address provided during the ordering process or stored in the client’s user account. Regardless of the communication channel used, the client must clearly state their order number and any other necessary details for identification (such as name and email address).

2. General Rules for Booking the Service

2.1 Ordering Process

Users may place an order with Cargosender using the following methods:

2.1.1 Online Platform

Users can place orders on the Cargosender.com online platform as either Registered or Guest users. Users may choose from the available services with visible prices offered on the platform. If none of the services meets the user’s specific needs, they may request a Custom Offer. In this case, an order is considered placed once the client accepts the received offer.

A registered user may also place a batch import order, which is considered placed once the client successfully uploads the completed template file with order details within their user profile.

Once the ordering process is completed on the online platform, the client can proceed with payment as per the methods outlined in section 2.2. The order is considered placed after successful payment or confirmation of the payment obligation. Cargosender then proceeds with booking the logistics service with the selected logistics provider. Once booked, the order is considered successfully submitted, and an email confirmation is sent to the client.

2.1.2 External Platforms

Cargosender may submit offers and bid for transportation requests using external platforms that are not managed by Cargosender. The client can confirm Cargosender’s offers according to the rules of these external platforms. When presented with an offer, the client is also given access to these Terms and Conditions through the same communication channel used for the offer or via another established communication channel.

The order is considered placed once confirmed according to the external platform's rules, which are applicable alongside these Terms and Conditions. Cargosender then proceeds with booking the logistics service with the selected logistics provider. Once booked, the order is considered successfully submitted, and an email confirmation is sent to the client.

2.1.3 Off-Platform Ordering

Clients may place orders directly with a Cargosender representative through established communication channels. The user must provide all necessary information to enable Cargosender to book the logistics service with the logistics provider as requested by the client.

Such orders may be processed upon the confirmation of these Terms and Conditions and those of the applicable logistics service provider. In the offer email, Cargosender will include the Terms and Conditions document (or a link to it). The client must review the Terms and Conditions, and by agreeing to the offer, the client agrees to the provided Terms and Conditions. If a representative of a corporate client confirms the offer and these Terms and Conditions, they are deemed authorized to accept the offer and Terms and Conditions on behalf of the client.

The client may agree to the Terms and Conditions for a single order, multiple orders within a defined period, or an undefined period (until the Terms and Conditions change). If the Terms and Conditions are updated, Cargosender is responsible for providing the client with the revised document.

The order for services may also be processed based on the contractual agreement between the client and Cargosender. In such a contract, the client and Cargosender may agree on provisions differing from these Terms and Conditions. In case of discrepancies, the contract shall prevail.

Once the client provides all necessary information for booking the logistics service or agrees to the relevant Terms and Conditions, the order is considered placed, and the payment obligation is confirmed as per one of the payment methods outlined in section 2.2. Cargosender then proceeds with booking the logistics service with the selected provider. Upon booking, the order is considered successfully submitted, and an email confirmation is sent to the client.

2.1.4 API Ordering

Clients may place orders via an integrated API connection, an interface that allows data exchange between two parties. Once the client provides the necessary information and agrees to the relevant Terms and Conditions, the order is considered placed, and the payment obligation is confirmed as per one of the payment methods defined in section 2.2.

Cargosender then proceeds with booking the logistics service with the selected provider. Once booked, the order is considered successfully submitted, and an email confirmation is sent to the client. Any IT intervention costs required for API integration are covered by the client unless otherwise agreed in advance.

2.1.5 Acknowledgement Presumption

Clients acknowledge that all ordering processes result in an order placed for a specific service type as described in Chapter 3. Clients are responsible for familiarizing themselves with and complying with both the logistics provider's and Cargosender's Terms and Conditions, especially the section relevant to the service for which the order was placed. Even if the client neglects this duty, their acknowledgment is presumed.

Cargosender is not obligated to provide additional translations of these Terms and Conditions or those of the logistics provider.

2.2 Payment Process

When placing an order, users are prompted to proceed with payment using a credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or bank transfer. Registered users can also choose to pay using credits or opt for deferred payment. Unless otherwise specified in the client’s Cargosender profile, invoices for Cargosender’s services are issued and sent to the email address provided during the order process. Any changes to the order may require the issuance of additional accounting documents, such as invoices or credit notes. Once issued, these documents are visible in the user profile of registered clients and are considered delivered once they are either emailed, uploaded to the user profile, or sent through any other established communication channel.

Registered clients can specify a dedicated email for receiving invoices in their user profile. Clients with collective invoicing enabled will receive invoices after the collective invoicing period ends. It is the client’s responsibility to regularly check their email, user profile, and other communication channels to ensure timely payment of any due amounts. Cargosender reserves the right to apply an additional payment processing fee for registered corporate clients based on the chosen payment method.

2.2.1 Payment via Credit Card

Credit card payments are processed securely through Cargosender’s payment processing partners and their banking partners. Cargosender does not store any credit card information, as the entire payment verification process is handled directly by its partners. Clients must ensure that the credit card used for payment is active and has sufficient funds. Any additional charges resulting from a declined credit card are the sole responsibility of the client.

2.2.2 Payment via PayPal

If the client selects PayPal as the payment method, they will be redirected to the PayPal website to log in or create an account if they don’t already have one. Clients must ensure their PayPal account is active and has sufficient funds. Any additional charges incurred due to a failed transaction will be the client's responsibility.

2.2.3 Payment via Google Pay

Clients opting for Google Pay will be prompted to choose a payment card from their Google Pay account. It is the client’s responsibility to ensure their Google Pay account is active and that the selected card has sufficient funds. Any additional charges resulting from a declined transaction will be borne by the client.

2.2.4 Payment via Apple Pay

For Apple Pay, clients will be prompted to select a payment card from their Apple Pay account. The client must ensure their Apple Pay account is active and the chosen card has sufficient funds. Any additional charges incurred due to a rejected transaction will be the client's responsibility.

2.2.5 Payment via Bank Transfer

If the client chooses to pay via bank transfer, the order will not be confirmed until the full payment is received in Cargosender’s bank account. Payment instructions, including the bank account details, will be provided during the order process or in a subsequent email. Clients must follow the reference data specified in the payment instructions. Any bank-related charges incurred during the transfer are the client’s responsibility. If the amount received is less than the required amount, the order will not be confirmed, and Cargosender is not obligated to notify the client of the insufficient payment. Wire transfers must be made in the specified currency and to the specified bank account. Any currency conversion fees will be the client’s responsibility.

2.2.6 Payment with User Credits

Using user credits allows clients to bypass entering payment data each time they book logistics services through Cargosender.com. Cargosender may offer loyalty discounts for orders paid with user credits. Clients must have sufficient credits in their account to confirm a booking. If additional credits are needed, clients can top up their account using a credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, or bank transfer, which may incur additional fees. Topping up credits via credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay will be automatically confirmed if sufficient funds are available.

2.2.7 Deferred Payment Option

When using the deferred payment option, the client confirms their obligation to pay by the due date specified on the invoice and in the transactional email. In the event of late payment, Cargosender reserves the right to apply a late payment fee, including (i) 8% interest on the outstanding amount from the due date until full payment, (ii) an administrative fee of 50 EUR, and (iii) any other costs related to payment recovery and debt collection.

2.3 Additional Charges

The client is responsible for any additional costs incurred by Cargosender or the logistics provider due to inaccurate information provided during the ordering process or if the shipment details do not comply with the terms, restrictions, and limitations of the selected service. Cargosender reserves the right to seek reimbursement for expenses covered on behalf of the client, even if invoiced by the logistics provider after the service is completed. An administrative fee of up to 15 EUR may be charged for handling such additional costs.

By accepting these Terms and Conditions, the client authorizes Cargosender to apply additional surcharges directly to the payment method used for the order. If Cargosender is unable to apply the charge automatically, the client will be notified and must pay the additional amount within seven (7) days. Any litigation and collection procedure costs will be borne by the client.

Cargosender reserves the right to charge the client if there is a sudden price change for the selected route. If the client refuses the extra charge, Cargosender may offer a full refund and withhold the order from the logistics provider.

If a shipment must be returned to the sender due to reasons not attributed to the logistics provider, any additional costs will be charged to the client, and any additional insurance will no longer be valid. If the logistics provider is unable to return the shipment, it may be destroyed without reimbursement, and the client will bear all disposal costs.

2.4 Cancellation and Refunds

Clients may cancel an order only in writing. If an order is canceled, the client agrees not to hand over any shipment to the logistics provider. If the shipment is handed over, the client will be responsible for all incurred expenses.

All orders are non-refundable once successfully paid or the payment obligation is confirmed, except if the client purchased the Flexible booking option. The Flexible booking option allows changes to order details without administrative fees and permits a refund request, provided the request is made before the first pick-up attempt by the logistics provider. Cargosender reserves the right to reduce the refundable amount if costs have already been incurred. The Flexible booking option can be purchased during the order process if available and is included for registered business users with this option confirmed in their account. The flexible booking fee is non-refundable.

Refunds, if granted, will be issued as credits to the client’s Cargosender account for future orders or to the same payment method used for the order, or another method as requested by the client. The refunded amount will be available within 30 days of Cargosender notifying the client of the refund approval. Additional costs may apply for refunds to the original payment method.

2.5 Claims and Complaints

In case of damage or loss of a shipment, the client may initiate a claim to seek reimbursement for the incurred loss. Orders are covered by the liability of the selected logistics provider or by Cargosender directly. Clients may also purchase additional insurance during the order process. Additional insurance policies offered are either from the logistics providers or Cargosender’s insurance partners as an auxiliary service.

If reimbursement is approved under the basic liability or insurance provided by the logistics provider, the client may only claim the difference up to the maximum reimbursement under the additional insurance policy. Additional insurance is contingent on the successful establishment of liability by the logistics provider.

Cargosender’s Claims department manages claims on behalf of clients against logistics providers or insurance companies. The logistics providers or insurance companies will provide a decision on the claim within the timeframes specified in their terms. Delays in receiving a decision do not constitute Cargosender’s responsibility.

Cargosender reserves the right to reject claims due to incomplete, misleading, contradictory, or false data provided by the client. Cargosender may also reject a claim if the client breached the Terms and Conditions. In such cases, no further claims from the client or related third parties will be recognized.

In case of damage or loss, the client must note this on the proof of delivery and inform Cargosender immediately (within the first business day after delivery) to start the claims process. Claims for damage cannot be initiated for damage to packaging but only for the contents of the shipment. Insurance claims are not valid for:

- Inappropriate packaging (including bundled parcels with a single label)
- Unconventional shipments
- Forbidden items
- Damages due to force majeure
- Lack of evidence proving the condition of the parcel before collection
- Any breach of the Terms and Conditions by the client

Claims unsupported by evidence of the item’s true value cannot be initiated. The only acceptable proof of value is the original invoice, with VAT and amortization deducted accordingly.

2.5.1 Damage Claim

To initiate a damage claim with Cargosender, the client must notify Cargosender of any damage on the delivery date using the online contact form at Cargosender.com. Cargosender will then provide instructions for obtaining the necessary documents, photos, and other information required to file a claim with logistics providers or insurance companies. The client must submit all requested documentation within 2 business days of receiving the claim instructions. Failure to provide the documentation within this timeframe may result in claims being rejected by the logistics providers or insurance companies due to delays.

For damaged shipments, the client must retain the shipment in its delivered condition, including covering any associated costs, until the insurance process is completed. If any part of the shipment is visibly damaged, the client should photograph the damage before removing the items from the packaging.

If the client notices missing items at delivery, they can initiate a claim. The client must provide similar documentation as for damage claims, including photos of the shipment before collection and at delivery, demonstrating that the items were opened or damaged during transport, leading to the missing contents.

In cases of damage or loss, the client must make a written note on the consignment note, prepare a damage report, and send it to Cargosender. Claims may be declined if no damage or loss is reported at the time of delivery.

2.5.2 Loss Claim

If a shipment is not delivered within five (5) working days of the expected delivery date, the client must immediately inform Cargosender using the online contact form at Cargosender.com. Cargosender’s support team will then contact the responsible logistics provider to initiate a search investigation if necessary. If the logistics provider is unable to locate and deliver the shipment promptly, Cargosender will notify the client that the shipment is officially considered lost and provide instructions for obtaining the necessary documents, photos, and other information to start a claim with the logistics providers or insurance companies.

The client must provide all required documentation to Cargosender within 2 business days of receiving the claim instructions. Late documentation may result in the claim being rejected by logistics providers or insurance companies due to delays.

If a claim is approved but the shipment is later found and delivered to the client, the client must return any reimbursement already received based on the approved claim.

2.5.3 Official Complaint

Clients may file an official complaint with Cargosender regarding services by using the online form available at Cargosender.com. To initiate the complaint procedure, all necessary information (including the client’s name, Cargosender order number, and relevant case details) must be submitted within seven (7) days after the most recent of the following events:
1. The last correspondence regarding the order;
2. The last update of the shipment status in the tracking system;
3. The order’s pick-up date;
4. The delivery date.

Cargosender will respond to the complaint within thirty (30) days of receipt.

3. General Shipping Rules

The following general rules apply to all orders booked with Cargosender, unless otherwise specified. The customer is responsible for understanding any special rules for their specific service type.

3.1. Packaging

Clients must ensure that their goods are packed with appropriate outer and inner packaging suitable for the type, weight, and content of the shipment. The packaging must be adequate for transport and handling at logistics centers. Inadequately packed items may result in the shipment being returned or rejected, and the client will be responsible for any related costs. Damaged or unsuitable packaging may lead to rejected insurance claims.

Cargosender and its logistics partners do not provide special handling for items marked as fragile. Automated handling processes may disregard such labels. Standard packaging includes a cardboard box with secure closure. Clients using non-standard packaging do so at their own risk and may incur additional charges. Packaging must withstand a fall from a height of one (1) meter.

Palletized cargo must be properly packed, stored, and secured on the pallet, which should not exceed the pallet's dimensions. Damaged pallets are not acceptable. Clients are responsible for the total weight and dimensions, including the pallet.

Clients must remove old labels from items before pick-up and ensure correct labeling. Proof of collection from the driver is required for any claims.

For services requiring shipping labels, each item must have a single label and be handed over to the driver as one piece. Any discrepancies in the number of items collected will not obligate Cargosender or the logistics provider.

3.2. Size and Weight Limitations

Prices are based on the declared size and weight of the shipment. Any excess will follow the procedure outlined in section 2.3. Clients should review the logistics provider’s Terms and Conditions for size and weight limitations. Exceeding these limits may result in collection or delivery refusal, with the shipment potentially being returned at the client's expense.

3.3. Pick-Up and Delivery

The shipment must be available for pick-up during the logistics provider’s working hours. Pick-up may occur earlier or later than scheduled. If the shipment is not collected as scheduled, the client must inform Cargosender immediately to arrange a second pick-up attempt. Additional costs may apply for failed pick-ups or deliveries.

Clients must provide accurate address details and ensure the shipment is easily accessible for pick-up and delivery. Any errors in details or failure to provide complete information will result in liability for associated costs.

Pick-up and delivery services are provided to the main door of the building. For freight or palletized cargo, clients are responsible for loading and unloading, including providing necessary equipment and manpower. Loading and unloading must occur from the ground floor within a 30-minute window; extended time may incur extra costs. Any additional costs from failed attempts or unprepared shipments will be billed to the client.

Cargosender does not guarantee delivery to an address different from the one provided. Address changes after label creation will not be accommodated. Local contact numbers must be provided for pick-up and delivery. The carrier may refuse service due to remote locations or regulatory issues.

Shipments may be deemed unacceptable for various reasons, including incorrect customs declarations or prohibited items. Unacceptable shipments will be returned or disposed of at the client’s expense.

Delivery may involve one or two attempts or a drop-off at a nearest access point, depending on the logistics provider. Deliveries to PO boxes are only possible if specified during booking. Deliveries are considered effective under several conditions, including delivery to any person at the address, an alternative address, or a nearby warehouse after failed attempts. Cargosender and logistics providers are not liable for damages or delays, and delivery times are estimates only.

3.4 Prohibited Items

The client agrees to the list of prohibited items outlined below and affirms that they will not ship any items included on this list or those prohibited by the Terms and Conditions of the chosen logistics provider or by applicable laws in the country of pick-up or delivery. Should the client ship prohibited items, they will be solely responsible for any damages and expenses incurred.

Examples of prohibited items include:

- Dangerous goods, hazardous materials, and flammable substances as classified by IATA (International Air Transport Association), ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization), or other relevant authorities (“Dangerous Goods”).
- Items that could potentially damage other shipments during transport.
- Valuable items such as works of art, jewelry (including watches), precious metals, precious stones, pearls, glass items, porcelain, earthenware, or similar materials.
- Antiques and furs.
- Cash, coins, collectible coins, stamps, and documents that can be exchanged for cash or goods.
- Alcohol and tobacco products.
- Liquids of any kind.
- Human remains, live animals or plants, and perishable food items.
- Goods requiring temperature-controlled transport.
- Items prohibited by law or regulations of any government or public authority in the countries of origin, transit, or destination.
- Substances needing special permits, handling, or documentation.
- For airfreight: all Lithium Ion and Lithium Metal shipments; prohibited goods as per regulation (EC) No 300/2008 and its amendments.
- Shipments covered by the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR).

The logistics provider reserves the right to refuse handling items deemed dangerous or damaging. If such items are submitted, the provider may remove or dispose of them without notice at the client’s expense. The client will be liable for any losses or damages resulting from these items and must indemnify both the logistics provider and Cargosender against all related claims, penalties, costs, and expenses.

Additionally, no insurance policy will cover the following items unless explicitly confirmed by the carrier or insurance company:
- Food (including liquid food).
- Fragile items such as glass and porcelain.
- High-value items.
- Individual items valued over EUR 5,000 (items valued above EUR 2,000 must be reported to Cargosender in writing).
- Items with sentimental value.

3.5 Customs

Cargosender does not act as a customs broker or agent and is not responsible for customs duties or procedures unless otherwise specified in the relevant shipping service type in Section 4. The client is responsible for understanding and complying with customs requirements in both the export and import countries according to local legislation and policies.

The client must fully cooperate with local customs authorities and bear any customs duties, taxes (including VAT, if applicable), penalties, storage charges, or other related expenses. Should Cargosender incur costs due to customs actions or inadequate documentation from the shipper or receiver, these costs will be passed on to the client or receiver and treated as additional charges according to Section 2.3.

Cargosender is not responsible for verifying or advising on the accuracy of information and documents provided. The client agrees to indemnify Cargosender against any claims arising from incorrect or fraudulent information provided and any resulting financial penalties.

For shipments to or from non-EU countries, the client must provide:
- A commercial invoice in English, including EORI number, a clear description of the goods, their value, currency, Incoterms, etc.
- A commodity code for each item.
- Advance notification for non-standard or temporary exports (e.g., repairs returning to the country of origin).
- Any necessary authorizations for direct representation of the client by the logistics provider, if required by law.
- Any required information or documents for customs authorities.

For freight/palletized cargo, the client must provide either customs-cleared cargo or details for customs clearance. Rates provided do not include customs clearance, duties, or taxes.

The client must attach necessary documents to the consignment note or make them available to the logistics provider. All customs and transportation documents must be completed accurately in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

If required documentation is not provided or is non-compliant, the logistics provider may refuse collection or return the shipment to the sender, incurring additional costs for which the client is responsible. 

The shipper certifies that all information provided for export and import will be accurate. Misrepresentation may result in civil or criminal penalties, including forfeiture and sale of the shipment.

4.4 Standard Pallets and Other Road Freight Cargo Shipping

4.4.1 Definition
Clients can ship non-standard, bulky items and standard pallets (palletized cargo) using our road freight cargo shipping service through the chosen logistics provider’s network. The prices quoted by Cargosender are based on stackable items. If a client provides non-stackable items, any additional costs will be their responsibility. For non-stackable shipments, clients must request a custom offer from Cargosender in advance. 

Prices on the Cargosender platform are estimates and may be adjusted based on seasonal conditions or other external factors affecting service costs.

Clients are responsible for accurately declaring the weight on the consignment note and may request a weight verification from the logistics provider at their own expense. Each item must have a label, which must be printed by the client or provided by the carrier at the time of collection.

4.4.2 Liability and Additional Insurance
Shipments under the Road Freight Cargo service are covered by the logistics provider’s liability as per the Convention on the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR). If the shipment’s value exceeds the liability coverage under CMR, clients can purchase additional insurance through Cargosender’s insurance partner, covering up to EUR 5,000 per shipment, provided both origin and destination countries are within the EU. Additional insurance claims are only valid after the logistics provider acknowledges liability for damages or loss.

The Van Delivery service utilizes vans to transport goods. Vans are road vehicles used for cargo transportation, and this service adheres to the CMR convention, applicable only in countries that have ratified it.

4.5.2 Preparation of Goods and Transport
By opting for this service, clients agree to use a curtain-sided or box van, subject to vehicle limitations. Clients may ship goods in cardboard boxes, palletized, or properly strapped without pallets. Improperly packed cargo may be rejected, and any associated costs will be borne by the client.

4.5.3 Restrictions and Limitations
The maximum loading weight for a curtain-side or box van is 1,000 kg, and for a van with a tail lift, it is 700 kg, including packaging. Clients are responsible for adhering to these weight limits and for any additional costs resulting from excess weight. The maximum dimensions of the van must be adhered to as specified during ordering.

4.5.4 Pickup & Delivery
Loading and unloading time is limited to 1 hour. Any extra time may incur additional costs for the client. 

4.5.5 Extras
Clients may order additional services during the booking process:

These additional services apply to ground floor loading/unloading only.

4.6 LTL and FTL Shipping Service

4.6.1 Definition
The LTL (Less-than-Truckload) and FTL (Full Truckload) services involve the road transportation of goods. LTL covers partial truckloads, while FTL is for full truckloads. This service uses semi-trailers or trailers and adheres to the CMR convention.

4.6.2 Preparation of Goods
Cargo must be packed and secured for truck transport, either as palletized or in cardboard boxes. 

4.6.3 Restrictions and Limitations
Clients are responsible for the declared weight and volume of their shipment. If actual weight or volume exceeds the ordered amount, additional charges will apply as per Section 2.3. Orders may be canceled, and additional costs may apply if there is empty capacity, with no refunds available. Clients must adhere to the dimensions, volume, and weight provided during the order process.

4.7 Vehicle Logistics Service

4.7.1 Definition
The Vehicle Logistics service involves transporting road vehicles using specially equipped trucks and trailers. This service adheres to the CMR convention, applicable only in countries that have ratified it.

4.7.2 Preparation of Vehicle
Vehicles must be clean, with all low-hanging parts, accessories, and non-permanently mounted racks removed or secured. Vehicles should be in good running condition (or non-running if specified) with no more than half a tank of fuel. Personal property is limited to one suitcase or bag (max 20 kg) in the trunk. The logistics provider is not liable for any personal items or damages resulting from improper loading. Vehicles improperly prepared may be rejected, and costs will be the client’s responsibility.

After loading, three copies of the consignment note, signed by the client and the logistics provider, must be prepared. The first copy is for the client, the second accompanies the goods, and the third is retained by the provider. The consignment note should comply with the CMR.

4.7.3 Pickup & Delivery
The logistics provider will pick up and deliver the vehicle as close as possible to the client's address, subject to access constraints. Estimated pickup and delivery dates will be provided, but no guarantees are made. Delays due to road conditions, weather, or other factors are not the responsibility of Cargosender or the provider, and costs related to delays are not covered.

In the client’s absence, a representative must be appointed to release or accept the vehicle. If collection or delivery cannot be performed due to access issues or refusal, the client is responsible for arranging a new location and covering any additional costs.

4.7.4 Liability and Insurance
The terms in Section 2.5 apply. The vehicle must be inspected for pre-existing damage at pickup, and a report must be completed and signed. At delivery, the vehicle will be inspected for transportation damage. The client must sign and receive a final copy of the consignment note.

Cargosender's responsibility ends upon delivery and receipt of the final inspection report. Any damages must be documented and signed for on the consignment note. By signing without reservations, the client confirms receipt of the vehicle in the same condition as at pickup, relieving Cargosender and the logistics provider of further responsibility.

4.8 Other Shipping Services

Cargosender may offer additional logistics services beyond those described in these Terms and Conditions. If you wish to book such services, the terms and conditions must be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties, typically through a formal contract. In the absence of a specific agreement, these Terms and Conditions will apply. For orders placed outside of our platform, the procedures outlined in Section 2.1.3 “Off-Platform Ordering” will apply.

Cargosender may periodically update the types of shipping services available. Any new shipping options will be accessible to clients upon their publication on Cargosender.com.
